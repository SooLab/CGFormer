# CGFormer
The official PyTorch implementation of the CVPR 2023 paper "Contrastive Grouping with Transformer for Referring Image Segmentation". (Coming Soon!)

CGFormer first introduces learnable query tokens to represent objects and then alternately queries linguistic features and groups visual features into the query tokens for object-aware cross-modal reasoning. This paper achieves cross-level interaction by jointly updating the query tokens and decoding masks in every two consecutive layers. In addition, we introduce new splits on datasets for evaluating generalization for referring image segmentation models.
